# üöñ Bisim App

## üåç Overview
Bisim App is a ride-hailing mobile application, similar to Uber, that connects passengers with drivers in real time. The app allows users to request a ride by selecting their location on a map, and nearby drivers can accept the request to provide transportation. The project was initially developed for iOS and written using Swift and Xcode.

## ‚ùì Why Ride-Hailing Apps Like Bisim App Exist
### üö¶ Transportation Challenges in Urban Areas
In the past, city transportation was divided into two categories:
- üöó People who owned a private vehicle.
- üöå People who relied on public transport or local taxi agencies.

With increasing fuel prices ‚õΩ, maintenance costs üõ†Ô∏è, and traffic regulations üöß, urban commuting became more challenging for both groups. Traditional taxi agencies had several drawbacks, such as high prices üí∞ and limited availability ‚è≥. People often had to wait for extended periods, especially during peak hours or late at night.

Ride-hailing apps like Bisim App emerged as a modern solution, offering on-demand rides with better accessibility, pricing, and convenience. These applications gained massive popularity as users sought more efficient transportation options. üöï

## ü§î Why Use Multiple Ride-Hailing Apps?
Many users install multiple ride-hailing apps for the following reasons:
- **üí∏ Cost Differences:** Each service may have varying ride prices, allowing users to choose the most cost-effective option.
- **üó∫Ô∏è Navigation Accuracy:** Some apps provide better routing to reduce delays.
- **üòä Driver Behavior & Service Quality:** The experience may differ based on company policies and driver professionalism.
